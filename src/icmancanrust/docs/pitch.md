Slide 2: Problem Statement

Title: The Problem with Traditional File Storage Services
Text: Traditional file storage services rely on centralized servers, making them vulnerable to hacking, data breaches, and censorship. Users have no control over their data, and have to trust third-party providers with their sensitive information.


Slide 3: Solution

Title: Secure and Decentralized File Storage on the Internet Computer
Text: Our solution leverages the power of the Internet Computer to provide a secure and decentralized file storage service. Users can store their files on the blockchain, ensuring that their data is safe from hacking and censorship. With no centralized servers, users have full control over their data.


Slide 4: Features

Title: Features
- Decentralized Storage - Users can store their files on the Internet Computer, ensuring that their data is secure and cannot be censored.
- End-to-End Encryption - Files are encrypted on the client-side and can only be decrypted by the owner of the private key.
- Immutable Storage - Files stored on the blockchain are immutable, ensuring that they cannot be tampered with or deleted.
- Access Control - Users can control who has access to their files, ensuring that their data is only accessible to authorized parties.


Slide 5: Technology

Title: Technology
- Internet Computer - Our solution leverages the power of the Internet Computer to provide decentralized file storage.
- Rust - We use the Rust programming language to build secure and performant smart contracts on the Internet Computer.
- Svelte - Our frontend is built using the Svelte framework, providing a fast and responsive user experience.
- Encryption - We use end-to-end encryption to ensure that files are securely stored on the blockchain.


Slide 6: Business Model

Title: Business Model
Text: We plan to monetize our solution by charging a small fee for file storage and access control services. We will also offer premium features such as increased storage capacity and priority support for power users.


Slide 7: Competition

Title: Competition
Text: Our solution is unique in its use of the Internet Computer to provide secure and decentralized file storage. Traditional file storage services such as Dropbox and Google Drive rely on centralized servers, making them vulnerable to hacking and censorship.
